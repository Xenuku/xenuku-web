	<!-- <p>
		My name is Liam. I enjoy building web applications and software. I'm currently a full-time
		university student, expecting to graduate mid-2023. I first got started with web development by
		customising forum themes and building small informational websites for myself back in 2010. I
		found a passion in what I created and since then I have worked as a web developer building with
		Wordpress, Laravel, and vanilla PHP. I have since moved further into the JavaScript side of the
		web, where I am enjoying ReactJS and Svelte. I also like exploring game and mobile application
		programming. I continue to learn both at university and in my free time, in all types of
		technologies that interest me. In my spare time I love reading Fantasy and Sci-Fi.
